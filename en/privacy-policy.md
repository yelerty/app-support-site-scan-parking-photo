This privacy policy applies to **the iOS app that scans car or parking lot photos taken by users to provide parking location guidance** (hereinafter "this app").

## 1. Information We Collect and Process

This app may collect and process the following information:

- **Photo metadata**: EXIF information such as shooting date and time, location (GPS coordinates)
- **Text information in photos (e.g. parking pillar alphabets/numbers, license plates)**: Extracted through character recognition (OCR) within the device
- **App usage records**: Minimal usage logs for error diagnosis (crash logs, etc.)

## 2. Processing Purpose

- To **record and guide parking locations** based on photos taken by users
- Service quality improvement and error analysis (optional)

## 3. Processing and Storage Method

- **The basic principle is local processing and storage within the device**.
- If the user activates iCloud backup/sync, it can be safely backed up to Apple's iCloud service.
- **Personal information transmission to developer servers is basically not performed**. If transmission is required for new features, we will notify and obtain consent in advance.

## 4. Third Party Provision and External SDKs

- This app currently **does not sell or share personal information to third parties**.
- If advertising or analytics SDKs are introduced, we will update this document with the items provided, purposes, and retention periods.

## 5. Retention and Disposal

- Parking records and related data are deleted from the device when the user deletes them within the app or removes the app.
- Diagnostic information such as crash logs may be retained and deleted according to iOS/Apple systems.

## 6. User Rights

- Users can **delete in-app records** at any time and change **photo and location permissions** in iOS settings.
- Contact request: [yelerty@gmail.com](mailto:yelerty@gmail.com)

## 7. Children's Personal Information

- This app is **not intended for children under 14 years of age**. If it is determined that personal information of users of that age has been collected, please let us know at the above contact information and we will delete it without delay.

## 8. Security Measures

- We follow the principle of in-device processing and iOS security systems, and request only minimum permissions (e.g. photo access permission, optional location permission).

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

- The policy may be modified due to changes in laws or services, and changes will be posted on this page with the **effective date** specified.
