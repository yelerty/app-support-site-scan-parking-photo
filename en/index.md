### Quick Guide (FAQ)

**Q. What information do you use?**
We use photo metadata (shooting date and time, location, etc.) and text within photos (e.g. alphabets/numbers on pillars) to record parking locations.

**Q. Where is the data stored?**
Basically stored within the device, and if the user activates iCloud sync, it can be backed up to iCloud.
